            Tabla is a generation old instrument said to be founded in 1750s by Ustad Shiddhar Khan. It is a percussion
            instrument that is played by striking the surface of the drum with the fingers. The instrument is made up of
            two drums, the smaller drum is called the "Dayan" and the larger drum is called the "Bayan". The Dayan is
            made of wood and the Bayan is made of metal. Recently from the past few years, the tabla has been gaining a
