                <h2>The Digital Library by Pt. Swapan Chaudhuri</h2>
                <p>This online library is a great resource for tabla enthusiasts to learn different rare compositions of
                    all
                    legendary tabla artists throughout history. It also includes videos to help students learn the
                    compositions
                    in a better way, just as a face-to-face teacher would. The library covers various styles such as
                    Punjab
                    Gharana, Delhi Gharana, and Farukhabad Gharana. However, it currently only allows compositions
                    verified
                    through Pt. Swapan Chaudhuri, and doesn't accept contributions from other artists. If the library
                    addressed
                    this, it would be an even greater resource for the tabla community.</p>

                <h2>Tihaai - Quintessence of Indian Percussive Arts by Shri Prabhakar Betrabet</h2>
                <p>This book by Shri Prabhakar Betrabet and Shri Sandeep Hattangady is a valuable resource for learning
                    how
                    to
                    compose and play tihais, a fundamental concept in Indian classical music. The book offers a clear
                    and
                    practical
                    approach to mastering this essential skill. It includes a CD with recordings of your teacher's
                    senior
                    students
                    demonstrating the concepts, making it even more helpful for students. However, the title may be a
                    bit
                    misleading,
                    as over half the book discusses your teacher's experiences as a musician rather than focusing solely
                    on
                    tihais.
                    Nevertheless, the content on tihais is excellent and provides valuable insights for tabla players.
