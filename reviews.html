    <h1>Tabla Learning Resources Reviews</h1>

        <h2>The Digital Library by Pt. Swapan Chaudhuri</h2>
        <p>This online library is a great resource for tabla enthusiasts to learn different rare compositions of all
            legendary tabla artists throughout history. It also includes videos to help students learn the compositions
            in a better way, just as a face-to-face teacher would. The library covers various styles such as Punjab
            Gharana, Delhi Gharana, and Farukhabad Gharana. However, it currently only allows compositions verified
            through Pt. Swapan Chaudhuri, and doesn't accept contributions from other artists. If the library addressed
            this, it would be an even greater resource for the tabla community.</p>

        <h2>Tihaai - Quintessence of Indian Percussive Arts by Shri Prabhakar Betrabet</h2>
        <p>This book by Shri Prabhakar Betrabet and Shri Sandeep Hattangady is a valuable resource for learning how to
            compose and play tihais, a
            fundamental concept in Indian classical music. The book offers a clear and practical approach to mastering
            this essential skill. It includes a CD with recordings of your teacher's senior students demonstrating the
            concepts, making it even more helpful for students. However, the title may be a bit misleading, as over half
            the book discusses your teacher's experiences as a musician rather than focusing solely on tihais.
            Nevertheless, the content on tihais is excellent and provides valuable insights for tabla players.</p>
