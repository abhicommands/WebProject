    <p>I will be going through chronologically the online records of different concerts and events that I have
        performed. In, these are videos that I recorded myself at different events I have played. And hope you can see
        the videos and enjoy them as well. </p>

        <p>This is my first ever solo, where I played a cool 16 beat cycle solo, at a
            competition, I actually got second place in this competition.</p>

        <p>This is my first big event, where I hosted a full concert of around 40 minutes, and
            this was a major event, this was actually at an examination board, SAMVED, where I gave my examinations and
            earned my Bachelors in Tabla, through this organization. This was a great achievement for me and a very
            specical day hence, I am also sharing this event.</p>

        <p>This is one of my first ever events playing with another Indian Classical
            instrument, called the Sitar. I learned a lot through this another young artist and he has been one of my
            best music buddies ever since then. This was a big moment for me accomapnying another instrument requires a
            lot of understanding and experience and doing this being one of my first is still a great thing for me, and
            I will never forget this. </p>
