    <h2>About Us: The Tabla Trio</h2>
    <p>This initiative was started in April 2013 when us 3 started to embark our journey in the field of Tabla. Now
        these three will be giving their groundbreaking knowledge to promote the art of tabla playing across
        generations.</p>

            <h3>Child Tabla Prodigy</h3>
            <p>Child Tabla Prodigy, despite only starting to play the tabla in 2013, quickly showed that prodigious
                talent can't be
                bound by age. Known for captivating audiences with his rapid-fire tabla beats, he has the uncanny
                ability to produce
                rhythms that even seasoned tabla players scratch their heads over. This young virtuoso has not only
                collected awards
                like they're going out of fashion, but he's also managed to convince his entire school that "tabla time"
                should be an
                official school subject. As the youngest member of our trio, he brings a fresh, dynamic energy that is
                both inspiring
                and a little bit intimidating.</p>

            <h3>Baldy Tabla Player</h3>
            <p>Meet Baldy Tabla Player, a man whose shiny bald head is only outshone by his brilliant playing. Starting
                his career as a
                curious child who thought the tabla was a strange wooden drum that could tell stories, Baldy has evolved
                into a goofy
                yet profound artist. His unique playing style combines the classical rigor of tabla with whimsical beats
                that often make
                you wonder if the tabla is laughing with you. Notorious for wearing colorful turbans to match his mood,
                Baldy is a fan
                favorite for his onstage antics and offstage jokes about how his bald head provides better acoustics.

            <h3>Mature Tabla Artist</h3>
            <p>Mature Tabla Artist, often called the encyclopedia of tabla, is one of the most in-demand tabla players
                globally. With a
                career spanning over four decades, he has accompanied some of the greatest names in music and is revered
                for his deep
                and soulful tabla sounds that resonate with the history of Indian classical music. Now stepping into a
                new role, he is
                founding a tabla teaching school, aimed at passing on his extensive knowledge to a new generation of
                players. His school
                promises to be a blend of rigorous traditional techniques and his own innovative methods, seasoned with
                stories from his
                tours around the world where he played from crowded temples to royal palaces.</p>
