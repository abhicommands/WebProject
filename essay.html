            <p>Welcome to our visual journey through a day in the life of a Tabla maestro. From the early morning
                rituals to late-night practice sessions, we invite you to experience the dedication and passion that

            <p>As dawn breaks, the quiet of the morning is filled with the resonant sounds of the tabla. The maestro

            <h3>Morning Rituals</h3>
            <img src="placeholder-image1.jpg" alt="Early Morning Practice">
            <p>The day starts early with a morning ritual of meditation and rhythmic breathing, setting the tone for a
                focused day of music. These moments of stillness are crucial for the maestro, allowing him to align his
                energy with the spiritual essence of the tabla.</p>

            <img src="placeholder-image2.jpg" alt="Preparing the Tabla">
            <p>Each tabla is carefully prepared, tuning the skins to perfection, ensuring every beat resonates with
                clarity. The maestro inspects each instrument with a meticulous eye, making minor adjustments to the
                straps and applying a mixture of ash and water to the surface, which helps produce the distinct pitch
                and tone the tabla is known for.</p>
